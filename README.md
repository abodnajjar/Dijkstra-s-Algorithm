This project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between countries around the world based on three criteria:

🌍 Distance

⏱️ Time

💰 Cost

Given a starting country and a destination, the algorithm calculates the most efficient route depending on your selected priority (distance, time, or cost).
It models international travel as a weighted graph where countries are nodes and the connections (flights, roads, etc.) are edges with weights based on the chosen metric.
